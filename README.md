Abstract. The goal of our project is to utilize factor models to explain returns and optimize the Sharpe
ratio to create a portfolio that outperforms the S&P 500. After rening our data we have a universe of
335 stock in which we can invest. We rebalance our portfolio quarterly and incorporate factor models
and Sharpe ratio optimization through cone programming to form the portfolio. The rest of the paper
is organized as follows: Section 1 is a short introduction ot our paper, Section 2 gives a brief idea of
the data available and what kind of choices we made to reach the nal universe of stocks, Section 3
gives an idea of the general methodoloy used in the paper, Section 4 describes thre results that we have
reached, section 5 presents the signicance test we performed, Section 6 presents the resulsts of dierent
sensitivity analysis and Section 7 summarizes the project and gives suggestions for further research.

Note: This was a course project for a course in Optimization modeling and was carried out in a team. Please open the Final report for more information
